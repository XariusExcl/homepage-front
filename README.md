A very simple static site using vite, threejs, tailwindcss and eleventy for blogging.

## Requirements

- A somewhat recent version of NodeJS (>=18) and NPM (like >=10 probably?).

- `npm run build` to build the whole website.
- `npm run build:blog` to only compile the markdown files in blog/ to static pages.
